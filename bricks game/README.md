# üß± Brick Breaker Game

A classic arcade-style Brick Breaker game built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, featuring intelligent auto-play AI and exciting power-up mechanics.

## üéÆ Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Classic Brick Breaking**: Destroy colorful bricks arranged in a 5x10 grid

- **Progressive Scoring**: Earn 10 points per brick destroyed

### Advanced Features
- **ü§ñ Auto-Play AI**: Intelligent paddle movement that automatically tracks and catches the ball
- **üí∞ Power-Up System**: Golden bonus boxes that fall from destroyed bricks
  - Worth +20 points when caught
  - Cost 1 life if missed (risk/reward mechanic)
  - 30% spawn chance from destroyed bricks
- **üéõÔ∏è Flexible Controls**: Switch between manual control (keyboard/mouse) and auto-play mode

### Visual & UI
- **Colorful Design**: Each brick row has a different vibrant color
- **Real-time Status**: Live score and lives counter
- **Auto-play Indicator**: Visual feedback showing current control mode
- **Responsive Controls**: Smooth paddle movement with multiple input methods

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional software or dependencies required

### Quick Start
1. **Download** or clone the project files
2. **Navigate** to the project directory
3. **Open** `index.html` in your web browser
4. **Play** immediately - no installation needed!

```bash
# If using git
git clone <repository-url>
cd "bricks game"
open index.html  # macOS
# or double-click index.html in file explorer
```

## üéØ How to Play

### Game Objective
Destroy all bricks to win the game while keeping the ball in play and collecting bonus power-ups.

### Starting the Game
1. Open the game in your browser
2. Press **SPACEBAR** to start
3. The game begins in auto-play mode by default

### Control Modes

#### Auto-Play Mode (Default)
- Paddle automatically follows the ball
- Perfect for watching or learning game mechanics
- Toggle ON/OFF with the **'A'** key

#### Manual Control
- **Arrow Keys**: Move paddle left/right
- **Mouse**: Move mouse to control paddle position
- Using arrow keys automatically disables auto-play

### Power-Up System
- **Golden Boxes** fall from destroyed bricks (30% chance)
- **Catch them** with the paddle for **+20 bonus points**
- **Miss them** and **lose 1 life** - high risk, high reward!

### Winning & Losing
- **Win**: Destroy all 50 bricks
- **Lose**: Run out of lives (ball falls below paddle or miss power-ups)

## üéÆ Controls Reference

| Key/Action | Function |
|------------|----------|
| **SPACEBAR** | Start/Restart game |
| **Left Arrow** | Move paddle left (disables auto-play) |
| **Right Arrow** | Move paddle right (disables auto-play) |
| **Mouse Movement** | Control paddle position |
| **'A' Key** | Toggle auto-play mode ON/OFF |

- **Tracking Algorithm**: Calculates optimal paddle position
- **Smooth Movement**: Gradual approach to target position
- **Collision Avoidance**: Boundary checking and constraint handling

### Power-Up System
- **Spawning**: Random generation based on probability
- **Physics**: Gravity-based falling motion
- **Collision**: Rectangle-based intersection detection
- **Risk Management**: Balance between reward and penalty

### Scoring System
- **Bricks**: 10 points each (base game)
- **Power-ups**: 20 points each (bonus)
- **Total Possible**: 500 base points + unlimited bonus points
